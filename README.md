# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection
ML model for detection and classification of Diabetic Retinopathy based on retinal scans

This was a class project for BIOE 485 Computational Math for ML and Image Processing. Data used for the purposes of training and testing the model can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection.
We were tasked with first creating a simple model to classify and detect DR before moving on to a neural network approach. Our first attempt used Stochastic Gradient Descent and was not successfull in differentiation between the different levels of DR severity. Our next attempt used a CNN model from the Keras package, results can be found in the juypter notebook. Our second model found more success than our first model, but still needed further improvements to bring the specificity in line with other models in the literature.
